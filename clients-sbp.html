          <h2><strong>PROCESS: </strong></h2>
          <p>At Mediscan, we specialize in filling your School District&rsquo;s contract, contract-to-hire, or direct hire positions within the realm of special education. From the first interview to the final hire, our customized process allows you to decide how involved you want to be as we identify the talent you need to keep your students progressing. </p>
          <p>It is part of Mediscan&rsquo;s culture of excellence to build solid relationships with our clients.  We want to know who you are, what you do, how you work, and who you like to work with. We develop a sixth sense for the types of candidates who will fit in with your special education department, and our extensive process of pre-vetting candidates means that we have the information on hand to respond to your needs – fast.</p>
          <p>We recognize that each position within the school district is unique and that a &ldquo;cookie-cutter&rdquo; approach to the recruitment process will not be effective. Our first step in partnering with you is to not only understand the challenges you are facing, but also gain a deeper  understanding of each position available.  Let us know what the preferred background and skill sets are necessary for each candidate to possess prior to being presented for consideration and we will make it happen.  </p>
          <p>We will also want to know the number of children on the caseload, as well as the ages and types of disabilities that each healthcare professional and/or educator will be treating. Additionally, we want to ensure we identify individuals who are going to fit the culture of the school(s) to which he/she will be reporting. This information will arm us with enough knowledge to qualify each individual&rsquo;s potential for success in a role in your school district.       </p>
          <p>Once we have this information, we will engage our broad and extensive network of healthcare professionals and special educators to ensure that we are presenting you with résumés of highly qualified potential candidates. Our candidates must pass through a rigorous evaluation process in order to join our team, so we are certain that we are sending only the very best candidates for your consideration.  You will always have the opportunity to interview and make the final hiring decision.  We are your partner.</p>

      <h2><strong>FAQS</strong></h2>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
      <p><strong>Why would a school system choose to partner with Mediscan?  </strong>The hiring managers at Mediscan are experts at recruiting and sourcing staff who may or may not be located in your immediate area.  Our bandwidth and expertise to find the best candidate (or candidates) for our client needs affords school systems the flexibility to address skills shortages and fluctuating demand.  We also handle unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, and tax issues for our temporary and contract workers.<strong> </strong></p>
      <p><strong>What types of positions can Mediscan fill?  </strong>The types of positions we have the ability to fill are exceedingly wide, and range from per diem and daily staffing, longer-term contracts, temporary-to-permanent, and direct-hire placements. We have the ability to provide staffing in all positions encompassed within the realm of special education. <strong> </strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p><strong>What responsibility does Mediscan have for the school-based therapists and special educators placed on site?  </strong>The day-to-day oversight of the employee varies for each specific client, but is generally provided by the client&rsquo;s on-site supervisor.  In certain cases, Mediscan can provide an on-site supervisor as needed.   Other responsibilities are managed by Mediscan, include, but are not limited to, payroll, insurance and other benefits, and workers&rsquo; compensation—alleviating human resource-related paperwork challenges, allowing the school administrators to focus on their core business.<strong> </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Is it possible for me to hire one of the temporary employees provided?</strong>  Yes, we understand that continuity of services for your students is of upmost importance.  Therefore, Mediscan allows clients to hire a temporary or contract employee as a permanent member of their teams. A one-time placement fee is negotiated to complete the hiring process.</p>
